                    <p>
                        Early in the '70, <strong>SIDEREA</strong> started her activities offering in those years to the Argentine Railways a new type of Composition Brake Shoe with Low Friction Coefficient and longer useful life, replacing the cast iron ones without requiring adjustments in the steering devices, granting operational economies, and so gradually expanding to other railways abroad.

        <section class="mainDetail">
                    
            <p> <strong>SIDEREA</strong> consolidated the leadership applying in those years concepts for the protection of the environment, producing new compounds 100% free of asbestos and other pollutants, giving rise to the manufacture of the first Composition Brake Shoe with Low Friction Coefficient anti pollutant, with a life span of approximately 8 to 10 times longer than the life span of the cast iron ones, comparing them under the same service conditions.
            </p>

            <p> The proved reduction in the operational costs, obtained using this first ecological Low Friction Brake Shoe has been extended to medium and high friction compounds, and it has not been surpassed yet by any other composition Brake Shoe.
            </p>    
            
            <p>Nowadays the production includes a wide range of models and designs of High, Medium and Low Friction Brake Shoes, and disc brake pads made according to drawings and requirements of more than 80 Railway Administrations of more than 20 different countries, where they are regularly used, offering lower operational costs and guaranteeing safety in train traffic in different services, with complex topographies and even under difficult weather conditions of up to -25ºC.
            </p>

            <h2>Company's Policy:</h2>
            <p><strong>SIDEREA</strong>'s policy is to know the user's requirements before selling him, searching for being useful, basing on a wide experience, offering new and sometimes revolutionary solutions, that result in reductions in Operational Costs, through composition compounds which are not abrasive to wheels nor harmful to environment.
            </p>

            <h2> Leadership in providing environment and ecology protection:</h2>
            <p> As it was mentioned before, in the early 1970s <strong>SIDEREA S.A.</strong> won her leadership in the industry of friction material for railway use, as she was the first manufacturer in the continent producing composition brake shoes free of asbestos and other pollutants of rails and environment, putting on the market the first environmentally friendly brake shoes.
            </p>

            <h2> Leadership in operational costs reduction:</h2>
            <p> <strong>SIDEREA</strong> is also a leader in generating economies for users, achieving a proved reduction in the operational costs, offering a brake shoe with an exceptional and still not surpassed long lasting life span, which is as minimum twice longer compared to that of similar products.
            </p>
            <p><strong>SIDEREA</strong>'s brake shoes are different from the conventional ones. They are made of severely selected raw material. Using a new manufacture methodology, compounds of lower abrasion and great performance are achieved. It is verified through the cost/ benefit concept.
